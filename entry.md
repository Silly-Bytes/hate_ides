Why do I hate IDEs
===================

Lets start by taking off discussion some important things:
* Using an IDE and taking advantege of what is has to offer doesn't mean you're
  a bad developer, and using a good text editor doesn't mean you're a good one
* Using an IDE *can* make you a bad programmer
* Relaying on an IDE can make you a bad developer

* Extra layer of issues and bugs
    * Does the server doesn't run? isn't your code, is the IDE!
    * The code doesn't compile? well, your code is ok, the IDE doens't kwon shit
      about the libraries
* Don't mess up with my files!
* Dont' mess up with my version control system
* Don't use the mouse!
    code is text, i wan't to keep my hands in the keyboard.
    Programming is already a very mental exausting task, why make it a phisical
    exausting task too? moving your hand from the keyboard from the mouse
    thousends of times to reach some stupid buttons in a GUI or to help text
    editing becouse the IDE's editor sucks is just plain stupid.
* Lots of very basic and routine operations requiere a mouse  click
* Don't waste my pixels! goddammit
* Editor! Please! A good editor!!! i work with text! don't force to use the mouse
  Syntax checking, completion, all of that is nice, but the editor is still the
  most important part.
* It should be programmable or die (Emacs, Vim, Sublime, Atom), if you don't
  have something you would like to have or you have an idea to improve your
  workflow you should be able to just implement it!
* Combine little, well written specialized tools following the UNIX philosophy,
  don't put everything in one gigantic and horrible heap
* How on earth is possible of a library to work on an IDE but not in another? it's
    already stupid and bad enought for it to be compiler dependend, but IDE
    dependet? you got to be fucking kidding me!
* Can you please stop drooping pop ups and hints to me so I can see the fucking
    code?
* Fast, simple and automatic is one thing; Treating the programmer as a retarded
is another
* Let me compile without the IDE!
* One tool for all the jobs
    You don't use an IDE for system configuration files, deamons configuration
    files, shell scripts or anything of that nature don't you? So... Master a
    good editor is a must.
* If the IDE knows more than you, you're a moron!. Programmers don't like magic.
* Automation is good!, but if you **have** to use an IDE to implement a SOAP web
    service in a friking JSF application because there is no other way in which
    you don't have to go through a traumatic process, then you are under lots of
    shit
    If you can't do ti without an IDE, your language sucks, you suck, or both




Of course not every IDE has all those problems at the same time but just a
subset of those.
Everything can be overcome, a good IDE is still possible
